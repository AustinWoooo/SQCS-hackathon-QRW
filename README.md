# SQCS-hackathon-Quantum-Random-Walk
You have to do the following things first.
pip install qiskit
pip install pylatexenc
#Description
We will start with qiskit anda simple program grammar to ensure that everyone can participate in the subsequent topics. On the second day, we will enter the theory of quantum random walk and the operation of the circuit. On the third day, we will teach half-adder and full-adder, and finally start. Design a quantum random walk!
